## Hi, Iâ€™m Blake! ðŸ‘‹

I am nearly a year into my coding journey and it has been a blast to say the least! On top of working a full-time job, most of my days are spent learning about computer programming, algorithms, and working on side projects! I have loved every minute of it.

I really love JavaScript and have done several projects using TypeScript and React! I recently switched from using Visual Studio Code to NeoVim. It was rather challenging but has ultimately helped me better understand my working environment and all the tools we take for granted with "fancy" IDE's. On top of that, I have really enjoyed learning more about complex programming languages such as C++ and the power of utilizing efficient algorithms in code.

I am always looking to collaborate and learn with others! If you are interested, shoot me an email @ bjmcbay@gmail.com! Keep on coding!
