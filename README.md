## Hi, Iâ€™m Blake! ðŸ‘‹

I am nearly a year into my coding journey and it has been a blast to say the least! On top of working a full-time job, most of my days are spent learning about computer programming, algorithms, and working on side projects! I have loved every minute of it.

I love working with JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. I feel that these tools give me a great way to interact with both the web and also build powerful backends. Lately, I have been spending my time learning about Statistical learning models and using Python to manipulate and read data in useful ways! 

I am always looking to collaborate and learn with others! If you are interested, shoot me an email @ bjmcbay@gmail.com! Keep on coding!
