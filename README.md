ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Blake! 

I am nearly a year into my coding journey and it has been a blast to say the least! On top of working a full time job, most of my days are spent about computer programming, algorithms, and working on side projects!
  
As of right now, my main focus has been to understand C++ and how it complies under the hood. I have spent a good amount of time learning how to use CMake and other tools to make this much easier! I recently switched from using Visual Studio Code to NeoVim. It was rather challenging but has ultimately helped me better understand my working environment and all the tools we take for granted with "fancy" IDE's. On top of that, I have also enjoyed using JavaScript, TypeScript and React to create some really awesome applications! 

I am always looking to collaborate and learn with others! If you are intersted shoot me an email @ bjmcbay@gmail.com!
